### Azure Virtual Machines 

#### Understanding Virtualization:

##### Before Virtualization:
- One physical server = One application.
- Resulted in:
  - Underutilized resources ; High costs ; Inefficiency

##### What is Virtualization?
  - **Virtualization** is the process of running **multiple virtual machines (VMs)** on a **single physical server**.
  - It is enabled by a special software called a **Hypervisor**.

##### Benefits of Virtualization:
- **Improved Resource Utilization** : VMs share CPU, memory, and storage on a single server.
- **Flexibility**  : Easily create, delete, or move virtual machines as needed.
- **Cost Efficiency**  : Maximizes use of existing hardware.
- **Scalability & Portability**  : VMs can be replicated or moved across environments easily.
