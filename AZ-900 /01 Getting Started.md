### Understanding the Need for Cloud Computing

#### ✅ Traditional Infrastructure Challenges:

##### 🔸 Peak Load Provisioning:
- Companies had to buy infrastructure based on peak usage (e.g., holiday seasons).
- Resulted in low utilization during off-peak periods (idle infrastructure).

##### 🔸 Startups' Dilemma:
- Had to invest heavily in infrastructure in anticipation of success.
- If not successful, that investment is wasted.

##### 🔸 General Problems Before Cloud:
- High upfront capital costs.
- Difficulty in predicting future demand (capacity planning).
- Low infrastructure utilization.
- Need for dedicated maintenance teams, which startups may not afford.

#### 🔹 What the Cloud Offers

##### ✅ On-Demand Resource Provisioning:
- Rent resources when needed and release when not needed.
- Called **elasticity** – resources scale with usage.

##### ✅ Key Benefits of Cloud:

##### 💰 Cost Efficiency:
- Shift from capital expenses to variable (operational) expenses.
- **Pay-as-you-go** model.

##### 📉 Economies of Scale:
- Cloud providers can negotiate better hardware prices.
- These savings are passed on to customers.

##### ⚖️ Capacity Flexibility:
- No need to guess or over-provision capacity.
- Scale up/down based on real-time needs.

##### 🌍 Global Reach:
- Deploy applications **worldwide in minutes**.

##### 🔧 No Infrastructure Maintenance:
- No need to maintain your own data centers.
