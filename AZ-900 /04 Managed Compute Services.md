### Managed Compute Services

- Cloud providers offer different service models to simplify this:
  - IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service
  - PaaS – Platform as a Service
  - SaaS – Software as a Service
  - Serverless

| IAAS                                  | PAAS                                  |

- #### IAAS
  - Example :
    - Deploying a Java app on an Azure VM: Create VM (Linux/Windows) > Install Java runtime > Deploy your app > Configure load balancing, scaling, and OS patches yourself.
    - Similar to running apps on servers in your own data center but on Azure’s infrastructure

- #### PAAS
  - Example :
    - Deploying a Java app using Azure App Service: Upload your code and configuration.
    - Azure takes care of OS, Java runtime, scaling, load balancing, and availability automatically.
