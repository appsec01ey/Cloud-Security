### Identity Management

#### What is Identity Management?
Identity management refers to the processes and technologies used to **identify, authenticate, and authorize users or entities** accessing resources in a cloud environment.  
It ensures that the **right individuals or applications have the right access to the right resources at the right time**.

#### Why Identity Management is Needed

#### 1. Diverse Resources
- Cloud resources: virtual machines, databases, storage, network services.
- Applications in the cloud: 
  - Internal (used by employees) 
  - External (used by customers or partners)

#### 2. Varied Identities
- **Human identities:** internal employees, external partners, customers.
- **Non-human identities:** applications, bots, or services that interact with resources automatically.

#### 3. Complex Access Needs
- Users may need to: Start/stop virtual servers, Access internal applications, Perform specific actions in cloud apps
- Applications may need programmatic access for automation.

#### Key Goals of Identity Management
1. **Identification**: Knowing who is accessing the system.  
2. **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of the user or application.  
3. **Authorization**: Controlling what actions can be performed on which resources.  
4. **Access Management**: Assigning and enforcing permissions consistently.

### **Concepts**
1. **Authentication** – Verifies the user.  
2. **Authorization** – Grants access to resources.  
3. **Avoid localized identity management** – Centralized solutions are better.  
4. **Single Sign-On (SSO)** – Authenticate once, access multiple services efficiently.  

- Centralized identity management, supported by solutions like **Microsoft Entra ID**, simplifies authentication, authorization, and access control across an enterprise environment.
